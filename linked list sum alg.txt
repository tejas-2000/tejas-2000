Certainly! Here's a high-level algorithm for the problem:

1. **Initialize the list and its size:**
   - Create an array to store the list elements (`list`).
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of elements in the list (`size`).

2. **Input elements into the list (if needed):**
   - If you already have a list, you can skip this step.
   - If not, take user input to determine the number of elements (`size`) and input the elements into the list.

3. **Input the element to search or add:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the element they want to search for or add to the list (`element`).

4. **Search for the element in the list:**
   - Use a loop to iterate through the list and check if the entered element matches any existing element.
   - If found, note the position of the element in the list.

5. **Print result or add the element to the list:**
   - If the element is found, print the position of the element in the list.
   - If not found, add the element to the list if there is space.
   - If the list is full, print a message indicating that the list is full and the element cannot be added.

Below is a pseudo-code representation of the algorithm:

```plaintext
Initialize list and size
Input elements into the list (optional)

Input element to search or add

position = search(element in list)

if position != -1:
    Print "Element found at position position + 1."
else:
    if size < MAX_SIZE:
        Add element to the list
        Print "Element added to the list."
    else:
        Print "List is full. Cannot add more elements."
```

Note: This algorithm assumes that the list is initially filled with elements, and the user is either searching for an existing element or trying to add a new element. The `MAX_SIZE` constant represents the maximum size of the list.
