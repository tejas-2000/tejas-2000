Certainly! Below is the algorithm for the program that creates an ordered linked list in ascending order:

1. **Define the Node Structure:**
   - Define a structure for a node in the linked list with integer data and a pointer to the next node.

2. **Define Insert Ordered Function:**
   - Define a function `insertOrdered` that takes a pointer to the head of the linked list and an integer value to be inserted.
   - Allocate memory for a new node.
   - If the list is empty or the value is smaller than the head's value, insert the new node at the beginning.
   - Otherwise, traverse the list to find the appropriate position to insert the new node while maintaining ascending order.
   - Insert the new node at the correct position.

3. **Define Print List Function:**
   - Define a function `printList` that takes a pointer to the head of the linked list and prints the elements in order.

4. **Define Free List Function:**
   - Define a function `freeList` that takes a pointer to the head of the linked list and frees the memory allocated for all nodes.

5. **Main Program:**
   - In the main program:
     - Declare a pointer to the head of the linked list (`list`).
     - Prompt the user to enter the number of elements (`n`) for the linked list.
     - Use a loop to dynamically insert elements into the ordered linked list based on user input.
     - Print the ordered linked list using the `printList` function.
     - Free the memory allocated for the linked list using the `freeList` function.

The provided C program in the previous responses follows this algorithm. It includes functions for inserting nodes into an ordered linked list, printing the list, freeing the allocated memory, and a main program that takes user input to build and display the ordered linked list.
