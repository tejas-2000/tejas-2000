Certainly! Here's a step-by-step algorithm to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack:

1. Create an empty stack to store operands.

2. Scan the postfix expression from left to right, one character at a time.

3. If the current character is an operand (a digit), convert it to an integer and push it onto the stack.

4. If the current character is an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), pop two operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

5. Continue scanning the expression until all characters are processed.

6. After scanning, the result will be at the top of the stack. Pop the result from the stack.

7. The result is the final evaluated value of the postfix expression.

Here's the algorithm in pseudocode:

```plaintext
function evaluatePostfix(postfixExpression):
    stack = createEmptyStack()
    
    for each character in postfixExpression:
        if character is operand:
            push(stack, convertToInteger(character))
        else if character is operator:
            operand2 = pop(stack)
            operand1 = pop(stack)
            result = performOperation(operand1, operand2, character)
            push(stack, result)
    
    finalResult = pop(stack)
    return finalResult
```
