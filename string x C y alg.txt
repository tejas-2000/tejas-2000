Certainly! Here's a step-by-step algorithm to determine if an input string is of the form "x C y" using a stack:
https://github.com/tejas-2000/tejas-2000/edit/LAB/string%20x%20C%20y.txt
1. Create an empty stack to store characters.

2. Scan the first half of the input string and push each character onto the stack.

3. Skip the middle character if the length of the input string is odd.

4. Scan the second half of the input string, and for each character:
   - Pop a character from the stack.
   - Compare the popped character with the current character from the second half.
   - If they are not equal, the input string is not of the form "x C y."

5. If the stack is empty after the second half is processed, the input string is of the form "x C y." Otherwise, it is not.

Here's the algorithm in pseudocode:

```plaintext
function isFormXY(inputString):
    stack = createEmptyStack()
    length = lengthOfString(inputString)

    // Step 2: Scan the first half of the input string
    for i = 0 to length/2 - 1:
        push(stack, inputString[i])

    // Step 3: Skip the middle character for odd-length strings
    if length is odd:
        i = length/2 + 1
    else:
        i = length/2

    // Step 4: Scan the second half of the input string
    for ; i < length; i++:
        poppedChar = pop(stack)

        // Compare popped character with the current character from the second half
        if inputString[i] â‰  poppedChar:
            return false // Not of the form "x C y"

    // Step 5: Check if the stack is empty
    return isEmpty(stack)
```

Note: The `createEmptyStack()`, `push()`, `pop()`, and `isEmpty()` functions are assumed to be implemented according to the stack operations described in the previous C program.
